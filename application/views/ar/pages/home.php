	<p>Welcome to MyAccelerated Reader!  MyAccelerated reader is a proof of concept website.  Or in other words, it may or may not work.  The goal was to see if it could be done.  I feel like over all the site was a success.</p>
	<p>The site is based on data located at the arbookfind.com website.  When my oldest child started the AR program at school we had a really hard time finding books that were right for him.  Arbookfind.com allows you to search a book by title and that is about it.  We wanted to search by age level or points.</p>
	<p>The site is also a work in progress.  When I get time I try to make it better with the idea that some day it will be done.  But it will probably never be done.</p>
